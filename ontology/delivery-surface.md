# Delivery Surface Ontology

This note defines the Telegram-facing ontology for turn delivery.

## Turn Artifacts

- **Terminal turn artifact**
  - `assistant_final`
  - the final assistant bubble that closes the turn

- **Pre-final visible artifact**
  - human-facing artifact that may appear before the terminal turn artifact,
    but never below it for the same turn
  - current examples:
    - `commentary`
    - `orchestration`
    - any future surfaced preview bubble explicitly promoted by product policy

- **Technical status artifact**
  - mutable execution-status surface for ephemeral technical detail
  - examples:
    - reasoning/thinking
    - tool lifecycle
    - command execution progress
    - file-change churn

- **User turn opener**
  - semantic fact that a new user turn has begun
  - this may be a visible user echo or a hidden internal prompt scaffold that
    still starts a real runtime turn

- **Turn generation**
  - per-topic ordering generation used to prevent stale close tasks and stale
    artifacts from reopening or reclosing a newer turn

- **Turn identity**
  - runtime-side identity for a specific user turn
  - duplicate suppression and canonical-message preference must be scoped to
    turn identity rather than to bare text alone

## Delivery Classes

- **history**
  - user-visible content that may appear in `/history`

- **progress**
  - live semantic progress that may drive Telegram status behavior

- **lifecycle**
  - ephemeral control markers that must not pollute `/history`

## Compact Telegram Contract

Durable bubbles in `compact` mode are intentionally narrow:

- user echo
- orchestration milestones
- final assistant text

In addition:

- latest commentary stays visible as a dedicated artifact
- technical execution classes stay out of permanent bubbles by default

Technical execution classes include:

- reasoning / thinking
- tool lifecycle
- command execution
- file-change churn

## Ordering Invariants

- pre-final visible artifacts already queued may land before the terminal final
  answer
- only after final assistant content has been delivered successfully does the
  pre-final visible surface close
- only after final assistant content has been delivered successfully does the
  technical status artifact close
- no late pre-final visible artifact may appear below the final answer for the
  same turn
- no late technical status artifact may appear below the final answer for the
  same turn
- if an already-started multipart send becomes stale mid-flight, the remaining
  parts must abort rather than leaking below the new boundary

## Preview Contract

When command/tool/file previews are surfaced:

- fenced code blocks contain only preview body lines
- truncation metadata lives outside the fenced block
- outcome metadata is a separate footer
- shell and file previews prefer `sh`
- structured payloads that are genuinely JSON prefer `json`
- the UI should not add a redundant footer like `completed · output 1 line(s)`
  when the preview already makes the outcome obvious
